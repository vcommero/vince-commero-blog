In this example, we simply map port 8000 of the host to%NL%port 8080 of the Docker (or whatever port was exposed in the Dockerfile):%NL%%NL%```sh%NL%docker run -d -p 8000:8080 --restart=always --cap-add=SYS_ADMIN --name=dillinger <youruser>/dillinger:${package.json.version}%NL%```%NL%%NL%> Note: `--capt-add=SYS-ADMIN` is required for PDF rendering.%NL%%NL%Verify the deployment by navigating to your server address in%NL%your preferred browser.%NL%%NL%```sh%NL%127.0.0.1:8000%NL%```%NL%%NL%## License%NL%%NL%MIT%NL%%NL%**Free Software, Hell Yeah!**%NL%%NL%[//]: # (These are reference links used in the body of this note and get stripped out when the markdown processor does its job.
